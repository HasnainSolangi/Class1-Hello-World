# Class001 First Program `Hello, World!`
Demonstrates a TypeScript program that prints 'Hello, World!' to the console. This example not only introduces the basic 'Hello, World!' output but also illustrates the usage of JSON functionality, such as creating JSON objects or parsing JSON strings. After compiling the TypeScript code into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (tsc), running the resulting JavaScript file in the command terminal will display the output.
